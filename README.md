# TopoTrek: Project Summary
## üéØ Project Goal: A Unified and Superior Hiking Navigation Experience
The primary objective of TopoTrek is to develop a premier hiking and outdoor navigation application that resolves the key frustrations users face with existing tools. The current market is fractured: generalist applications like Google and Apple Maps are dangerously unreliable for backcountry use, while specialized apps force a compromise. Users often choose between the socially-driven, but often inaccurate, trail discovery of platforms like AllTrails and the powerful, but complex and less user-friendly, navigation tools like Gaia GPS and OnX.

TopoTrek aims to bridge this gap by creating a single, integrated platform that delivers both intuitive trail discovery and a robust, reliable, and visually stunning navigation engine. The core mission is to combine the best features of its competitors‚Äîsocial proof, high-quality data layers, and powerful offline capabilities‚Äîinto one seamless and beautiful user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è A Modern, Open-Source Technology Stack
A key pillar of the TopoTrek strategy is its reliance on a powerful, customizable, and cost-effective open-source technology stack. This approach avoids vendor lock-in and provides complete control over the application's features and performance.

Core Technology Components
Map Rendering & Visualization: The visual heart of the app will be powered by `MapLibre`, a community-driven fork of Mapbox GL. This choice eliminates licening fees and allows for deep customization. The app's signature feature will be its beautiful 3D terrain visualization, achieved by processing high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from sources like `USGS 3DEP` into a `Terrain-RGB` tile format. For efficient and exceptionally low-cost global delivery of these map tiles, the plan specifies using the `PMTiles` archive format hosted on `Cloudflare R2`.

Intelligent Routing Engine: For navigation, TopoTrek will utilize a self-hosted instance of `Valhalla`. Valhalla's standout feature is its dynamic, run-time costing, which enables the creation of highly personalized hiking routes based on user preferences like fitness level, desired elevation gain, and preferred trail surfaces. This moves beyond simple point-to-point directions to offer a truly intelligent routing experience.

Cross-Platform Development: The application will be built using `React Native` with `Expo's Bare Workflow`. This framework allows for a single codebase to target both iOS and Android, while the Bare Workflow provides the necessary access to native code required for high-performance modules like `MapLibre Native`.

Data and Backend: The backend will be built on a scalable, serverless microservices architecture using `AWS Lambd`a for compute and `Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL` with the `PostGIS` extension. PostGIS is critical for efficiently storing and querying the geospatial data that forms the foundation of the app, including user-created routes, points of interest, reviews, and photos. Initial trail data will be sourced from `OpenStreetMap (OSM)`, with a long-term strategy to build a proprietary, curated, and more reliable trail database through community contributions.

By integrating these technologies, TopoTrek is positioned to be a visually superior, highly functional, and community-driven application that sets a new standard for digital cartography in the outdoor recreation space.
